This project uses the LinkedList.java, Data.java, Inspection.java, Restaurant.java, and the RestaurantList.java classes to collectively
store the data from the CSV file and retain information that is necessary and that doesnâ€™t have certain missing info, 
such as the date, the inspection results (which include the score, inspection date, risk, and violation), 
and store all of these inspections into a separate restaurant object (depending on the location) and those 
restaurants will then be added to the RestaurantList object which will hold these restaurants. 
The SFRestaurantData.java class is what accepts user input and searches for the data to find what the user inputted. 
It adds each matching name or zip according to the user input to the RestaurantList object. Then each restaurant object is iterated through and printed.
